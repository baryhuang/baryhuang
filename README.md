# Hi there, I'm Bary Huang üëã

**CTO @ PeakMojo (https://peakmojo.com)** ‚Ä¢ Seattle  
Building the #1 AI-native platform for sales, customer success and engineering hiring, onboarding, onboarding‚Äîvoice-AI simulations, predictive MojoScore‚Ñ¢ leaderboards, and MCP-powered AI.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Do

### Autonomous AI Agent / MCP Server Development
I'm currently focused on building Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that enable AI agents to interact with various services and platforms:

* **[awesome-claude-code-agents](https://github.com/honeybluesky/awesome-claude-code-agents)** - Claude Code Multi-agent agents that just work

* **[applescript-mcp](https://github.com/peakmojo/applescript-mcp)** - MCP server that execute applescript giving you full control of your Mac

* **[agent-guard](https://github.com/peakmojo/agent-guard)** - AI agents that simulate voice calls to test production AI systems through realistic conversational scenarios

* **[mcp-openmemory](https://github.com/baryhuang/mcp-openmemory)** - Simple standalone MCP server giving Claude the ability to remember your conversations and learn from them over time.

* **[agentic-mcp-client](https://github.com/peakmojo/agentic-mcp-client)** - The first open-source standalone agent runner that executes tasks using MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools via Anthropic Claude, AWS BedRock and OpenAI APIs. It enables AI agents to run autonomously in cloud environments and interact with various systems securely.

* **[mcp-remote-macos-use](https://github.com/baryhuang/mcp-remote-macos-use)** - The first open-source MCP server that enables AI to fully control remote macOS systems through screen sharing. Allows AI agents to capture screenshots, send keyboard inputs, control mouse movements, and interact with any macOS application.

* **[mcp-hubspot](https://github.com/baryhuang/mcp-hubspot)** - MCP server for HubSpot CRM integration, allowing AI models to interact with HubSpot data and operations through a standardized interface.

* **[mcp-headless-gmail](https://github.com/baryhuang/mcp-headless-gmail)** - Headless Gmail integration through MCP, enabling AI assistants to read, search, and send emails.

* **[mcp-server-zoom-noauth](https://github.com/peakmojo/mcp-server-zoom-noauth)** - A MCP server for accessing Zoom recordings and transcripts without requiring direct authentication from the end user.

* **[mcp-server-any-openapi](https://github.com/baryhuang/mcp-server-any-openapi)** - Production-grade solution for API spec analysis that indexes and queries OpenAPI endpoints using endpoint-centric semantic search.

* **[mcp-server-aws-resources-python](https://github.com/baryhuang/mcp-server-aws-resources-python)** - MCP server for AWS resource management through Python's boto3, enabling AI agents to work with AWS infrastructure.

### Tech Stack
