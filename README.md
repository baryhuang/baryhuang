# Hi there, I'm Bary Huang üëã

## About Me
AI Engineer focused on building intelligent agent systems and Model Context Protocol (MCP) infrastructure. Based in Seattle, I'm currently working on [PeakMojo](https://peakmojo.ai), building innovative AI-powered solutions for sales training and customer success.

I'm passionate about leveraging AI technology to create practical tools that empower human-AI collaboration through standardized protocols. My work spans from backend development to AI agent architecture, with a focus on building infrastructure that connects AI models to real-world applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Do

### Autonomous AI Agent / MCP Server Development
I'm currently focused on building Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that enable AI agents to interact with various services and platforms:

* **[mcp-remote-macos-use](https://github.com/baryhuang/mcp-remote-macos-use)** - The first open-source MCP server that enables AI to fully control remote macOS systems through screen sharing. Allows AI agents to capture screenshots, send keyboard inputs, control mouse movements, and interact with any macOS application.

* **[my-apple-remembers](https://github.com/baryhuang/my-apple-remembers)** - MCP server for reading and managing Apple Notes on macOS, giving AI assistants access to personal note content.

* **[mcp-hubspot](https://github.com/baryhuang/mcp-hubspot)** - MCP server for HubSpot CRM integration, allowing AI models to interact with HubSpot data and operations through a standardized interface.

* **[mcp-headless-gmail](https://github.com/baryhuang/mcp-headless-gmail)** - Headless Gmail integration through MCP, enabling AI assistants to read, search, and send emails.

* **[mcp-server-any-openapi](https://github.com/baryhuang/mcp-server-any-openapi)** - Production-grade solution for API spec analysis that indexes and queries OpenAPI endpoints using endpoint-centric semantic search.

* **[mcp-server-aws-resources-python](https://github.com/baryhuang/mcp-server-aws-resources-python)** - MCP server for AWS resource management through Python's boto3, enabling AI agents to work with AWS infrastructure.

### Tech Stack
* **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript
* **AI & ML**: Model Context Protocol (MCP), OpenAI API, Anthropic Claude
* **Cloud**: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes
* **Containerization**: Docker, buildx for multi-platform builds
* **API Integration**: REST APIs, OpenAPI specifications
* **Remote Control**: Screen sharing, keyboard/mouse automation

## üîç I am Interested in Working On
* Advancing AI agent capabilities through MCP infrastructure
* Building better tools for AI-human collaboration
* Cross-platform AI agent control systems
* Integrating AI with enterprise platforms and services
* Containerized solutions for AI tooling
